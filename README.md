<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The purpose of this project is to build an elastic application that can automatically scale out and in on demand and cost-effectively by using the PaaS cloud. Specifically, we will build this application using AWS Lambda and other supporting services from AWS. AWS Lambda is the first and currently the most widely used function-based serverless computing service. We will develop an application that is more sophisticated than Group Project 1, as we are now more experienced with cloud programming and PaaS also makes it easier for us to develop in the cloud. Our application will still offer a meaningful cloud service to users, and the technologies and techniques that we learn will be useful for us to build many others in the future.

More Details are written on the pdf.
